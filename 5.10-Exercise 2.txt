Exercise 2: Write another program that prompts for a list of numbers as above and at the end prints out both the maximum and minimum of the numbers instead of the average.
代码如下：
Max = None
Min = None
while True:
n= input(“Enter a number: ”)
    if  n == “done”
        break
    try:
        n = float(n)
    except:
        print(“%s is not a number” %n)
        continue
        Max = n
    if Min is None or Min >n:
        Min =n
print(“Maximum:”, Max, "Minimum:", Min)
